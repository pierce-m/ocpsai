 * Routine Description:

 *  [in] object_type – sai object type
 *  [in] object_count – number of objects
 *  [in] object_key  - List of object keys
 *  [inout] attr_count – List of attr_count. Caller passes the number
 *          of attribute allocated in. Callee returns with the actual
 *          number of attributes filled in. If the count is less than
 *          needed, callee fills with the needed count and do not fill
 *          the attributes. Callee also set the corresponding status to
 *          SAI_STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.
 *
 *  [inout] attrs – list of attributes for every object. Caller is
 *          responsible for allocating and freeing buffer for the attributes.
 *          For list based attribute, e.g., s32list, oidlist, callee should
 *          assume the caller has not allocate the memory for the list and
 *          should only to fill the count but not list. Then, caller
 *          can use corresponding get_attribute to get the list.
 *
 *  [inout] object_statuses – status for each object. If the object does
 *          not exist, callee sets the correpsonding status to SAI_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_ID.
 *          If the allocated attribute count is not large enough,
 *          set the status to SAI_STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.
 *
 * Return Values:
 *  SAI_STATUS_SUCCESS on success
 *  Failure status code on error
